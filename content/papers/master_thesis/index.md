## Abstract

Complex dynamical systems are found across various scientific disciplines, representing phenomena like atmospheric and oceanic behavior, brain activity, robot state
in its environment, among many others. Due to the challenges that those systems
may address, it is often impractical to observe their complete state, leading to the
collection of partial observations. For instance, weather stations can only measure a
limited number of variables like temperature and pressure, but not the entire state
of the atmosphere. However, despite the limited nature of those observations, we
can still use them to infer and deduce states that are consistent with the gathered
data. By leveraging advanced inference methods, we can make predictions about
the complete state of complex dynamical systems.
