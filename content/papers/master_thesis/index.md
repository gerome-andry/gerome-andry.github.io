## Abstract

Complex dynamical systems are found across various scientific disciplines, representing phenomena like atmospheric and oceanic behavior, brain activity, robot state
in its environment, among many others. Due to the challenges that those systems
may address, it is often impractical to observe their complete state, leading to the
collection of partial observations. For instance, weather stations can only measure a
limited number of variables like temperature and pressure, but not the entire state
of the atmosphere. However, despite the limited nature of those observations, we
can still use them to infer and deduce states that are consistent with the gathered
data. By leveraging advanced inference methods, we can make predictions about
the complete state of complex dynamical systems.

##### References

I wanted to highlight here two fantastic papers about data assimilation using score-based models. I worked with the main author ([Francois Rozet](https://francois-rozet.github.io/)) during my thesis and he helped me a lot for the SBM part.

The first paper draws the basics of **S**core-based **D**ata **A**ssimilation that infers full state trajectories by assimilating any differentiable observations in a zero-shot way. ([*link to paper*](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.10574))

The second one is a direct application of **SDA** for a large scale physical problem. It shows that the method scales consistently with clever architecture engineering. ([*link to paper*](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.01853))
